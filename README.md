👋 Hi, I’m @toko315
👀 I’m interested in AI, education technology, and creating engaging learning experiences.
🌱 I’m currently learning about advanced kanji writing techniques and how to integrate AI tools into educational platforms.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative educational projects, particularly those involving AI and the Metaverse.
⚡ Fun fact: I love working on creative projects and enjoy exploring new technologies like LEGO Fortnite and Cluster for building virtual worlds.
